- **There should be enough color contrast between the button, the text inside the button, and the background to ensure readability.**
- **This component's visual presentation is  button-like, but it is coded as a link.** To maintain accessibility, ensure that the ARIA `role="button"` is preserved, so that screen readers announce it as a button. JavaScript has also been added so that keyboard users can activate the button using both the Enter and Spacebar keys. See for reference: [Understanding Success Criterion 4.1.2 Understanding WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-rsv.html).
- **The language of each page should be identified using the HTML lang attribute** (`<html lang="en">`, for example). Please see [H57: Using the language attribute on the HTML element](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H57).
